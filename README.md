# Expo CLI Unexpected Error: Version Mismatch or Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: unexpected errors stemming from version mismatches between the CLI, the project's Expo SDK version, or conflicts caused by multiple Node.js or npm installations.

## Problem

The Expo CLI might throw unexpected errors and prevent successful development server startup or building processes.  This often occurs if the installed Expo CLI version isn't compatible with the project's `package.json` configuration or if there are conflicts in the Node.js and npm environments.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Expo CLI, Node.js, and npm versions are compatible and that there are no conflicting installations.

1. **Verify Node.js and npm versions:** Use `node -v` and `npm -v` to check. Ensure they are up-to-date and suitable for your project.
2. **Update Expo CLI:** Use `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` or `yarn global add expo-cli@latest` to update to the latest stable version.  Consider using `npx expo start` to avoid global installation problems.
3. **Check `package.json`:** Verify that the `expo` and `expo-cli` versions specified in `package.json` are compatible and aren't outdated. 
4. **Clean and reinstall:** Delete the `node_modules` folder, `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), and then reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
5. **Manage Node.js versions (if necessary):** Tools like nvm (Node Version Manager) can help manage multiple Node.js versions and prevent conflicts.
