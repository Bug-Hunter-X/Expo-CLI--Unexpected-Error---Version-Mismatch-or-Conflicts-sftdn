This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the version of Expo CLI installed on your system and the project's configuration.  It might manifest as an inability to start the development server or other build-related issues. For instance, if your project uses a newer Expo SDK version which is not compatible with your Expo CLI version, it could trigger this unexpected behavior.  Another possible source of the problem is having multiple versions of Node.js or npm installed, creating conflicts.

Example of a relevant error message fragment: `Error: expo-cli: Command failed with exit code 1`
