The solution involves a multi-pronged approach to address potential version conflicts:

1. **Update Expo CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli@latest
```

2. **Check and update Node.js and npm:** Ensure both Node.js and npm are up-to-date.  Consider using a version manager like nvm to switch between Node versions and maintain a clean environment.

3. **Verify project's package.json:** 
Make sure the specified Expo SDK version in your project's `package.json` is compatible with the installed Expo CLI version. Update or downgrade accordingly.

4. **Clean install:** 
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf package-lock.json # or yarn.lock
npm install
```

By addressing these points, the majority of unexpected Expo CLI errors stemming from version mismatches or conflicts should be resolved. If problems persist, consider providing more details such as the full error message, your Node.js and Expo versions, and your project's `package.json`.
